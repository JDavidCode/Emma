Instead, they have their own unique forms. Keep practicing, and you'll become more familiar with irregular verbs in no time!

            "content": "Of course! Let's continue with the question about the difference between \"affect\" and \"effect\".\n\n\"Affect\" and \"effect\" are two words that are often confused because they sound similar and have related meanings. However, they are used in different ways:\n\n1. \"Affect\" is usually used as a verb and refers to the action of influencing or producing a change in something. It is used to describe the impact or influence that one thing has on another. For example:\n   - The rainy weather affected my mood.\n   - The new policy will affect the company's profits.\n\n2. \"Effect\" is usually used as a noun and refers to the result or consequence of an action or event. It is used to describe the outcome or the end result. For example:\n   - The effect of the rain was a flooded street.\n   - The new policy had a positive effect on employee morale.\n\nRemember the mnemonic \"Affect is an Action, Effect is an End result\" to help you remember the difference between the two.\n\nI hope this clarifies the difference between \"affect\" and \"effect\" for you.
